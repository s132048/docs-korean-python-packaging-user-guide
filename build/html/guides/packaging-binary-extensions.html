<p>One of the features of the CPython reference interpreter is that, in
addition to allowing the execution of Python code, it also exposes a rich
C API for use by other software. One of the most common uses of this C API
is to create importable C extensions that allow things which aren’t
always easy to achieve in pure Python code.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Use cases</a><a class="headerlink" href="#use-cases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The typical use cases for binary extensions break down into just three
conventional categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">accelerator modules: these modules are completely self-contained, and
are created solely to run faster than the equivalent pure Python code
runs in CPython. Ideally, accelerator modules will always have a pure
Python equivalent to use as a fallback if the accelerated version isn’t
available on a given system. The CPython standard library makes extensive
use of accelerator modules.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">wrapper modules: these modules are created to expose existing C interfaces
to Python code. They may either expose the underlying C interface directly,
or else expose a more “Pythonic” API that makes use of Python language
features to make the API easier to use. The CPython standard library makes
extensive use of wrapper modules.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">low level system access: these modules are created to access lower level
features of the CPython runtime, the operating system, or the underlying
hardware. Through platform specific code, extension modules may achieve
things that aren’t possible in pure Python code. A number of CPython
standard library modules are written in C in order to access interpreter
internals that aren’t exposed at the language level.</p>
<p>One particularly notable feature of C extensions is that, when they don’t
need to call back into the interpreter runtime, they can release CPython’s
global interpreter lock around long-running operations (regardless of
whether those operations are CPU or IO bound).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all extension modules will fit neatly into the above categories. The
extension modules included with NumPy, for example, span all three use cases
- they move inner loops to C for speed reasons, wrap external libraries
written in C, FORTRAN and other languages, and use low level system
interfaces for both CPython and the underlying operation system to support
concurrent execution of vectorised operations and to tightly control the
exact memory layout of created objects.</p>

<div class="section" id="disadvantages">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Disadvantages</a><a class="headerlink" href="#disadvantages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The main disadvantage of using binary extensions is the fact that it makes
subsequent distribution of the software more difficult. One of the
advantages of using Python is that it is largely cross platform, and the
languages used to write extension modules (typically C or C++, but really
any language that can bind to the CPython C API) typically require that
custom binaries be created for different platforms.</p>
<p>This means that binary extensions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>require that end users be able to either build them from source, or else
that someone publish pre-built binaries for common platforms</li>
<li>may not be compatible with different builds of the CPython reference
interpreter</li>
<li>often will not work correctly with alternative interpreters such as PyPy,
IronPython or Jython</li>
<li>if handcoded, make maintenance more difficult by requiring that
maintainers be familiar not only with Python, but also with the language
used to create the binary extension, as well as with the details of the
CPython C API.</li>
<li>if a pure Python fallback implementation is provided, make maintenance
more difficult by requiring that changes be implemented in two places,
and introducing additional complexity in the test suite to ensure both
versions are always executed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another disadvantage of relying on binary extensions is that alternative
import mechanisms (such as the ability to import modules directly from
zipfiles) often won’t work for extension modules (as the dynamic loading
mechanisms on most platforms can only load libraries from disk).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="alternatives-to-handcoded-accelerator-modules">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Alternatives to handcoded accelerator modules</a><a class="headerlink" href="#alternatives-to-handcoded-accelerator-modules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When extension modules are just being used to make code run faster (after
profiling has identified the code where the speed increase is worth
additional maintenance effort), a number of other alternatives should
also be considered:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>look for existing optimised alternatives. The CPython standard libary
includes a number of optimised data structures and algorithms (especially
in the builtins and the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">collections</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">itertools</span></code> modules). The
Python Package Index also offers additional alternatives. Sometimes, the
appropriate choice of standard library or third party module can avoid the
need to create your own accelerator module.</li>
<li>for long running applications, the JIT compiled <a class="reference external" href="http://pypy.org/">PyPy interpreter</a> may offer a suitable alternative to the standard
CPython runtime. The main barrier to adopting PyPy is typically reliance
on other binary extension modules - while PyPy does emulate the CPython
C API, modules that rely on that cause problems for the PyPy JIT, and the
emulation layer can often expose latent defects in extension modules that
CPython currently tolerates (frequently around reference counting errors -
an object having one live reference instead of two often won’t break
anything, but no references instead of one is a major problem).</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://cython.org/">Cython</a> is a mature static compiler that can
compile most Python code to C extension modules. The initial compilation
provides some speed increases (by bypassing the CPython interpreter layer),
and Cython’s optional static typing features can offer additional
opportunities for speed increases. Using Cython still has the disadvantage
of increasing the complexity of distributing the resulting application,
but has the benefit of having a reduced barrier to entry for Python
programmers (relative to other languages like C or C++).</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://numba.pydata.org/">Numba</a> is a newer tool, created by members
of the scientific Python community, that aims to leverage LLVM to allow
selective compilation of pieces of a Python application to native
machine code at runtime. It requires that LLVM be available on the
system where the code is running, but can provide significant speed
increases, especially for operations that are amenable to vectorisation.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Alternatives to handcoded wrapper modules</a><a class="headerlink" href="#alternatives-to-handcoded-wrapper-modules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The C ABI (Application Binary Interface) is a common standard for sharing
functionality between multiple applications. One of the strengths of the
CPython C API (Application Programming Interface) is allowing Python users
to tap into that functionality. However, wrapping modules by hand is quite
tedious, so a number of other alternative approaches should be considered.</p>
<p>The approaches described below don’t simplify the distribution case at all,
but they <em>can</em> significantly reduce the maintenance burden of keeping
wrapper modules up to date.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">In addition to being useful for the creation of accelerator modules,
<a class="reference external" href="http://cython.org/">Cython</a> is also useful for creating wrapper
modules. It still involves wrapping the interfaces by hand, however, so
may not be a good choice for wrapping large APIs.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><a class="reference external" href="https://cffi.readthedocs.io/">cffi</a> is a project created by some of the PyPy
developers to make it straightforward for developers that already know
both Python and C to expose their C modules to Python applications. It
also makes it relatively straightforward to wrap a C module based on its
header files, even if you don’t know C yourself.</p>
<p>One of the key advantages of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cffi</span></code> is that it is compatible with the
PyPy JIT, allowing CFFI wrapper modules to participate fully in PyPy’s
tracing JIT optimisations.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><a class="reference external" href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a> is a wrapper interface generator that
allows a variety of programming languages, including Python, to interface
with C <em>and C++</em> code.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The standard library’s <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ctypes</span></code> module, while useful for getting access
to C level interfaces when header information isn’t available, suffers
from the fact that it operates solely at the C ABI level, and thus has
no automatic consistency checking between the interface actually being
exported by the library and the one declared in the Python code. By
contrast, the above alternatives are all able to operate at the C <em>API</em>
level, using C header files to ensure consistency between the interface
exported by the library being wrapped and the one expected by the Python
wrapper module. While <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cffi</span></code> <em>can</em> operate directly at the C ABI level,
it suffers from the same interface inconsistency problems as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ctypes</span></code>
when it is used that way.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="alternatives-for-low-level-system-access">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Alternatives for low level system access</a><a class="headerlink" href="#alternatives-for-low-level-system-access" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For applications that need low level system access (regardless of the
reason), a binary extension module often <em>is</em> the best way to go about it.
This is particularly true for low level access to the CPython runtime
itself, since some operations (like releasing the Global Interpreter Lock)
are simply invalid when the interpreter is running code, even if a module
like <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ctypes</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cffi</span></code> is used to obtain access to the relevant C
API interfaces.</p>
<p>For cases where the extension module is manipulating the underlying
operating system or hardware (rather than the CPython runtime), it may
sometimes be better to just write an ordinary C library (or a library in
another systems programming language like C++ or Rust that can export a C
compatible ABI), and then use one of the wrapping techniques described
above to make the interface available as an importable Python module.</p>

<p>Before it is possible to build a binary extension, it is necessary to ensure
that you have a suitable compiler available. On Windows, Visual C is used to
build the official CPython interpreter, and should be used to build compatible
binary extensions.</p>
<p>Python 2.7 used Visual Studio 2008, Python 3.3 and 3.4 used Visual Studio 2010,
and Python 3.5+ uses Visual Studio 2015. Unfortunately, older versions of
Visual Studio are no longer easily available from Microsoft, so for versions
of Python prior to 3.5, the compilers must be obtained differently if you do
not already have a copy of the relevant version of Visual Studio.</p>
<p>To set up a build environment for binary extensions, the steps are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>For Python 2.7</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Install “Visual C++ Compiler Package for Python 2.7”,
which is available from
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=44266">Microsoft’s website</a>.</li>
<li>Use (a recent version of) setuptools in your setup.py (pip will
do this for you, in any case).</li>
<li>Done.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For Python 3.4</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Install “Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 4” (v7.1),
which is available from
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=8279">Microsoft’s website</a>.</li>
<li>Work from an SDK command prompt (with the environment variables
set, and the SDK on PATH).</li>
<li>Set DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1</li>
<li>Done.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For Python 3.5</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Install <a class="reference external" href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx">Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition</a>
(or any later version, when these are released).</li>
<li>Done.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Note that from Python 3.5 onwards, Visual Studio works in a backward
compatible way, which means that any future version of Visual Studio will
be able to build Python extensions for all Python versions from 3.5 onwards.</p>
